## Bionformatics Specialization
This repository contains activities from the bioinformatics specialization offered by University of California San Diego on Coursera.
This specialization consists of six courses and one last project for conclusion. The purpose behind this repository is contain every important aspects of each one of the course sections for future consultations and to serve as a possible guide for those who may be interested in bioinformatics. The figures and some of the texts parts were taken from the course's pratical sections. Any doubt or suggestions, please, let me know.

* Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)
  * [Finding ori region -> K-mers and The Clump Finding Problem.](https://github.com/nilbsongalindo/bioinformatics_specialization/blob/master/Fiding%20Hidden%20Messages%20in%20DNA.ipynb)
